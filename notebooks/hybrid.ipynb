En nuestro caso, podemos simular este entorno simplemente haciendo que las fases de entrenamiento como de subida de datos sean \"agendadas\" (_scheduled_), de manera que cumplan un cierto tiempo de reloj determinado antes de completarse. De esta manera, se verá reflejado el impacto que tendrá la estrategia de selección mediante la estimación de estos recursos.\n","\n","---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GS_QNYeT7tuM"},"source":["## Inicialización de los recursos de los clientes\n","\n","El siguiente paso para construir este entorno de simulación es determinar los recursos iniciales que tendrán los clientes. Los clientes son en esencia dispositivos (e.g. móviles, coches inteligentes, SmartTVs, ...) que tienen ciertas especificaciones que definen los recursos que posee. HybridFL así como FedCS, consideran dos tipos de recursos en los dispositivos:\n","\n","- Recursos de comunicación inalámbrica: que influye directamente en la comunicación entre el servidor y los clientes (e.g ancho de banda en red, congestión de la red, _Resource Blocks_ $^1$). Podemos determinar la capacidad de comunicación de los clientes con el servidor en __cuánta cantidad de información es capaz de enviar en un segundo__, a lo que también se le conoce como _throughput_, y utilizamos como unidades estándar Mbit/s.\n","\n","- Recursos computacionales: que influye en las actualizaciones del modelo en los clientes. HybridFL implementa el concepto de entrenamiento centralizado en el servidor; por tanto, como una suposición estándar en FL, suponemos que el servidor central tiene suficiente potencia computacional como para sobrepasar a los clientes en velocidad por la existencia de _stragglers_ [4]. Por lo que el tiempo de actualización de reloj del servidor la suponemos __nula o despreciable__. Podemos determinar la capacidad computacional de los clientes como __el número de ejemplos que puede procesar en un segundo__ actualizar el modelo [1].\n","\n","- Permiso de subida de datos: este tipo de recurso, propio de HybridFL, es básicamente el permiso del cliente de subir sus datos al servidor, cuyo número de clientes se asume muy pequeño (menos del $\\%1$ como mínimo [1]).\n","Por tanto, para poder muestrear en cada ronda de FL los recursos de los clientes, inicializamos primero las capacidades computacionales y de comunicación medias de cada cliente, de manera que en cada ronda se puedan samplear con una distribución Gaussiana truncada [5] como lo hacen los autores en [1]. Concretamente, el _throughput_ medio de los clientes se ha extraído de los experimentos hechos en un entorno simulado de comunicaciones inalámbricas de [1], en el que concluyeron que los clientes presentaban un _throughput_ de $\\theta^{\\text{avg}}_{k} = 1.4$ Mbit/s de media y un máximo de hasta $8.6$ Mbit/s, que resultan valores realistas en una red LTE. En cuanto a la capacidad computacional, se muestrea el número de datos procesados por segundo en entrenamiento de una distribución uniforme $\\gamma^{\\text{avg}}_{k} \\sim U(10, 100)$. Finalmente, se elige de forma aleatoria y uniforme si el cliente $k$ permite su subida de datos en un ratio de $r_{\\text{UL}} = 0.01$.\n","\n","> $^1$ Aunque el número de bloques de recursos o RBs (la unidad mínima de ancho de banda en LTE [3]) puede influir significativamente en el tiempo de comunicación entre el servidor y los clientes, seguiremos la suposición de [2] por el que los RBs asignados a cada cliente son los mismos para todos, de esta manera solo nos preocupan factores más fluctuantes en casos reales como el ancho de banda.\n",">\n","> [1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07210\n",">\n","> [2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08333\n",">\n","> [3] _S.
